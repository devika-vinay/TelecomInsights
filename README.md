# üìû Telecom Customer Insights

This project explored customer data from a mobile telecom network to uncover **drivers of dropped calls, usage patterns, and service quality issues**. The analysis focused on linking customer demographics, devices, and plans with network performance outcomes.  

---

## üîç Objectives  

1. Examine the relationship between **postal codes** and dropped calls to identify if certain regions faced worse network reliability.  
2. Visualize **subscription patterns across tariff plans**.  
3. Investigate whether specific **handset models** were linked with higher dropped call rates.  
4. Explore combined effects of **region, tariff plan, and handset model** on call drop frequency.  
5. Provide actionable recommendations to reduce dropped calls and improve customer experience.

## üìä Key Insights  

- **Regional disparities**: Certain postal code clusters showed significantly higher call drop rates, indicating possible weak network coverage or infrastructure gaps.  
- **Tariff plan composition**: Some plans had disproportionately high subscriptions but also carried elevated drop-call complaints.  
- **Device-specific issues**: Certain handset models consistently correlated with above-average dropped call counts, suggesting potential incompatibility or weaker signal handling.  
- **Interaction effects**: Customers in **specific regions**, using **certain handset models**, and subscribed to **specific plans** experienced markedly higher call drop frequencies compared to peers.

## üí° Recommendations  

- **Targeted network upgrades** in postal code clusters with highest call drop concentration.  
- **Re-negotiate handset support**: Work with manufacturers of high-drop models to improve firmware, or disincentivize their use through upgrade offers.  
- **Tariff plan adjustments**: Plans showing poor performance could be bundled with device/coverage support initiatives.  
- **Proactive monitoring**: Deploy anomaly detection for new handset‚Äìplan‚Äìregion combinations to catch emerging issues early.  
- **Customer communication**: Offer personalized alerts and support in high-drop regions to reduce churn risk.

## üìÇ Project Notes  

- Built and executed on **Databricks**.  
- Technologies used: **PySpark, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data handling and visualization.  
- Deliverables included regional trend plots, plan‚Äìdevice breakdowns, and recommendation slides.
